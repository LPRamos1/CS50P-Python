# Week 1 - Conditionals

This week covers decision-making logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

* **`meal.py`**: A time-based logic script that converts string input into floating-point numbers to categorize meal times.
* **`deep.py`**: A simple implementation of case-insensitive string matching to solve "The Great Question".
* **`interpreter.py`**: A basic math expression parser that processes user input and performs calculations dynamically.
